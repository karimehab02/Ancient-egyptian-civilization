        <div>
            <p>“Look, the pharaohs were 100% Egyptian. They belonged to the Nile Valley civilization that was born and developed in Egypt itself. Their culture, language, religion, and politics were uniquely Egyptian – not imported from somewhere else.</p> 
            <p>When people say the pharaohs were ‘Africans’ or ‘Afros’ in the sense of being sub-Saharan or Black African, that’s historically inaccurate. Yes, Egypt is in Africa, but the ancient Egyptians were North Africans, not sub-Saharan.  </p>
            <p>Genetic studies on ancient mummies clearly show that they were closer to Near Eastern and Mediterranean populations than to sub-Saharan Africans. Modern Egyptians actually have more African admixture than the ancient pharaohs did, because of later migrations.  </p>
            <p>Of course, there were periods like the 25th Dynasty when Nubian kings from the south ruled Egypt. But that’s just one chapter in thousands of years of history. The vast majority of pharaohs were native Egyptians. </p>
            <p>So the bottom line is: the pharaohs were Egyptian and only Egyptian. They weren’t ‘Afros’ in the modern racial sense, and trying to claim them that way is rewriting history.”</p>
