            <p>Egyptian architecture was built to last forever. From the pyramids of Giza to the temples of Luxor and Karnak,</p>
                <p> these monuments showed the power of pharaohs and the devotion to the gods. Obelisks, statues, and columns became timeless symbols of strength and eternity. </p>
                <p>For Egyptians, death was only the beginning. Through mummification, bodies were preserved with linen, oils, and amulets to secure eternal life.</p>
                <p> The golden mask of Tutankhamun and the preserved mummy of Ramses II remind us of their belief in immortality.</p>

            <p>The Pharaohs' Golden Parade. In this grand procession, 22 royal mummies — 18 kings and 4 queens — were moved with great ceremony through the streets of Cairo to their new resting place at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. This event reflected the timeless respect Egyptians hold for preserving their ancestors and the eternal journey of the soul.</p>
