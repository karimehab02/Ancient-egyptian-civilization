            <p>Art and hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt were more than decoration — they were a language of symbols. 
                From temple walls to papyrus scrolls, Egyptians used images, colors, and carvings to tell stories,
                 honor the gods, and preserve their history for eternity.</p>

                <p>Ancient Egyptian art was not just for decoration
                    — it was deeply religious and symbolic.
                    Statues, wall paintings, and carvings were created to honor the gods,
                    celebrate pharaohs, and guide souls in the afterlife.</p>
                    <ul>Colors had meanings:</ul>
                    <li style="color: #D49908;">Gold → divinity and eternity</li>
                    <li style="color: #44725A;">Green → fertility and rebirth</li>
                    <li style="color: #54586C;">Blue → protection and the Nile</li>

                <p>Hieroglyphics were called “the language of the gods” by Egyptians.
                    They combined pictures and symbols to represent sounds, words, or entire ideas.
                    Used on temple walls, tombs, and papyrus scrolls to record prayers, laws, and history.
                </p>
                <ul>Example:</ul>
                <li>Eye of Horus → protection</li>
                <li>Scarab → rebirth</li>
                <li>Sun disk → god Ra and life</li>
